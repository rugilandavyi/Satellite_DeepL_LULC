This on the task of classifying land use and land cover by utilizing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. These images, available through the Copernicus Earth observation program, are freely accessible. We introduce an innovative dataset derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images, encompassing 13 spectral bands and comprising 10 classes, totaling 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images. To evaluate this new dataset and its spectral bands, we employ cutting-edge deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly Res-Net50, and provide benchmark results.
